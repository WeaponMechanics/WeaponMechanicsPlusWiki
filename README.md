WeaponMechanicsPlus (_WMP_) adds attachments to both [WeaponMechanics](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/weaponmechanics-guns-in-minecraft-1-12-2-1-20-2.99913/) and [ArmorMechanics](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/armormechanics-custom-armor-for-your-guns-1-13-2-1-20-2.103179/). WMP also adds firemodes, and placeholders.&#x20;

### Getting Started

To install the plugin:

1. Download the latest `WeaponMechanics.jar` and `MechanicsCore.jar` [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/weaponmechanics-guns-in-minecraft-1-12-2-1-20-4.99913/).
2. Download the latest `WeaponMechanicsPlus.jar` [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/weaponmechanicsplus.113789/).
3. Add all 3 .jar files into your <mark style="color:yellow;">your server -> plugins</mark> folder.
4. Make sure to delete any old versions you may have previously downloaded.

When configuring the plugin:

WMP doesn't use it's own configs. Instead, these 2 folders are generated:

> <mark style="color:yellow;">your server -> plugins -> WeaponMechanics -> attachments</mark>
>
> <mark style="color:yellow;">your server -> plugins -> WeaponMechanics -> placeholders</mark>

Other configs, like [firemode.md](firemode.md "mention"), go directly into each weapon config.&#x20;

### Other

WeaponMechanics(Plus) can be difficult to configure. This wiki should be used in conjunction with the [WeaponMechanics](https://app.gitbook.com/o/MgHAZkcfIhs3YcmBjk2r/s/nwFaVZ2SN7YPdxsP5G6f/ "mention") wiki.&#x20;
