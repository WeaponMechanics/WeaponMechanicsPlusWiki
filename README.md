# Home

WeaponMechanicsPlus (_WMP_) adds attachments to both [WeaponMechanics](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/weaponmechanics-guns-in-minecraft-1-12-2-1-20-2.99913/) and [ArmorMechanics](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/armormechanics-custom-armor-for-your-guns-1-13-2-1-20-2.103179/). WMP doesn't use it's own configs. Instead, these 2 folders are generated:

> <mark style="color:yellow;">your server -> plugins -> WeaponMechanics -> attachments</mark>
>
> <mark style="color:yellow;">your server -> plugins -> WeaponMechanics -> placeholders</mark>

Other configs, like [firemode.md](firemode.md "mention"), go directly into each weapon config.&#x20;
